# Building a Fintech Startup and Scale it
*Start small.*

Consider a startup with limited budget is building a fintech product with 2 junior developers and 1 senior developer. The current engineering team located in Southeast Asia country and the founders also would like to build the future team in this region. the cloud provider has been decided to use AWS.

**Let's start the journey**

Building apps is not necessarily in one go. Delivering in iteration will give us a way to engage the potential user as early as possible while also giving us more perspective in delivering. We will decide how many phases we are going to do.

## Considerations
### Speed to launch
Considering we need to be fully aware of the speed of launch: the tech stack and infrastructure chosen must have many **out-of-the-box components** by default that fulfill the bare minimum needs of the core product.
### Cost
Besides monetary costs, there is also maintenance cost. based on my experience, many projects/organizations focusing much on reducing a lot in terms of monetary cost but overlook how much maintenance will cost them. Thus managed services provided by the Cloud provider are preferred.
### Tech Scalability
This all depends on the team's size and expertise when we start the project as it will influence a lot in terms of how much we want to delegate the auto-scaling parts to the service that the cloud provider has.
### Team Scalibility
One factor that often also overlooks is how could we also scale the team, not only the software and infrastructure. Nowadays, there is high competition in getting talent to join the company. Tech stack chosen will influence the potential talents to join for the reason of tech attractiveness. Failing to scale the team will certainly affect scaling the products/features, the organization wants.
